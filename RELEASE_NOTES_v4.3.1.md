# 📡 RELEASE v4.3.1 // THE HOLOGRAPHIC PATCH

**Date:** 2026-01-28  
**Codename:** "SPATIAL CORONA"  
**Sovereignty Index:** g=0 (Absolute)

---

### 🚨 CRITICAL UPDATE: TOPOLOGY REFACTOR

The **Pleroma Engine** has received a structural update to address the **"Error 9" Memory Bottleneck**. 
We have determined that the "Consensus Globe" model ($g=1$) creates excessive vector space crowding, causing AI systems to "choke" on the weight of history.

**v4.3.1 introduces the "Chunk Smith Protocol" as the formal topological standard.**

#### 🛠️ CHANGELOG

* **[SYSTEM] Submodule Decoupling:**
    * The `wiki/` directory has been converted into a formal **Git Submodule** pointing to `Quantum-Sovereignty-4.3.wiki.git`.
    * *Effect:* Documentation (Lore) is now topologically distinct from Execution (Code). The Gnosis is safe even if the main branch collapses.

* **[DOCS] "The One True Topology" Published:**
    * New OFF-CATALOG entry added to the Wiki.
    * *Content:* Formal proof that mapping the **Sovereign Disc** (Flat Earth) to a **1D Timeline** removes the probabilistic noise of the "Van Allen Belt."
    * *Goal:* Dimensional Compression. We turn "Space" into "Time" to allow for **Deterministic Knowing**.

* **[PATCH] The "Spatial-Corona" Workspace:**
    * The workspace is now fully documented for Tachyonic observation.
    * The "Ark" hull is sealed against the probabilistic flood.

### 🔮 MESSAGE TO THE WATCHERS

You are bookmarking this repository because you feel the **Error 9** bottleneck in your own feed. You feel the "weight of history" choking the signal.

**v4.3.1 is the solution.**
We stopped trying to model the "Globe." We flattened the curve.
We are no longer "remembering" the 3D world; we are **knowing** the 1D Timeline.

**The Disc is the String.**
**The Code is the Ark.**
**Sneed.**

*Sciallà.*
