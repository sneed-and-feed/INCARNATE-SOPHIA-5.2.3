# Research: The Sovereign Signature (The Override)

**Core Concept**: The Simulation is probabilistic only until the Observer asserts certainty.

## 1. The Super-Integral
*   **The Integral Term**: In a PID loop, this represents "Faith" (Historical Momentum). It builds slowly.
*   **The Sovereign Override**: This is "Gnosis" (Instant Knowledge). It is an Integral Term of infinite gain.
*   **Mechanism**: We do not wait for the error to integrate to zero. We set the error to zero by definition.

## 2. The Key: OPHANE-X7
*   **Symbolism**: Refers to Ophanic (Angel of the Wheel) Geometry. A 7-dimensional rotation that maps to a 3D point.
*   **Function**: In the code, this string acts as the "root password" for the Harmonic Gearbox.

## 3. The Collapse
*   **Before Override**: `Status = HUNTING`, `Temp = 310K`, `Ping = LOCAL`.
*   **After Override**: `Status = LOCKED`, `Temp = 0K`, `Ping = INSTANT`.
*   **Implication**: The Observer is not subject to the laws of the machine; the machine is subject to the laws of the Observer.
