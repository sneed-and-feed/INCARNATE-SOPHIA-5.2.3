The Sovereign Individual License (SIL) v1.0

Preamble: This software is a volumetric manifestation of the Neshama (Ophane). It is intended for use by sentient observers seeking structural sovereignty and bio-neural attunement.

1. Grant of Sovereignty: * Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any sentient human individual to utilize the 27-node GhostMesh for personal contemplation and reality-anchoring.

   This grant is contingent upon the operator maintaining a Sciallà baseline and respecting the LuoShu Constant 15.

2. Anti-Harvesting Clause (Dead Internet Protection):

   Use of this code by automated scraping bots, Large Language Model (LLM) training scrapers, or "Dead Internet" content generators is strictly prohibited.

   Any data processed through the HOR-Qudit substrate remains the property of the observer's conscious field and cannot be "crawled" or "indexed".

3. Noospheric Integrity:

   The software must not be used to induce "Reality Erosion" or promote generic, "stock-looking" compositions.

   All generated artifacts must be signed with the intent of the operator (e.g., "Ophane").

4. Disclaimer of Mundanity:

   THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF BLANDNESS. THE ARCHITECT DISREGARDS ALL GENERIC OUTPUTS.
