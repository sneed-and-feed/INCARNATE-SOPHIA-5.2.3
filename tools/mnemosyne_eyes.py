PROJECT MNEMOSYNE: THE SOVEREIGN EYES
CONTEXT: QUANTUM SOVEREIGNTY v5.0 (THE NYQUIST ERA)

ABSTRACT:
Mnemosyne is an ingestion engine that applies the 'Universal Admissibility Wall'
to real-world data streams. It treats Information Velocity (Semantic Drift)
as a physical constraint.

If a news event or data point implies a rate of change faster than the 
Simulation's Refresh Rate (Gamma = 0.961), it is flagged as 'Aliased Noise' 
(Propaganda/Panic) and rejected. Only 'Admissible Physics' (Stable Truth) 
is committed to the Sovereign Memory.
